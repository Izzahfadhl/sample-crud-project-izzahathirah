# daylog

A new Flutter project.

    DaylOg application is designed to function as a personal diary and reminder.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Setup Application

To run the sample-crud-project, follow these steps:

1. Extract the ZIP File:
    Unzip the downloaded file to a directory on your computer.

2. Set Up Android Emulator: 
    If you don’t have an emulator set up, you'll need to create one (e.g., Android Virtual Device Manager).

3. Install Flutter SDK:
    If you haven’t already, make sure you have Flutter installed. Follow the installation instructions on the official Flutter website.

4. Open Terminal or Command Prompt:
    Navigate to the extracted project directory using the terminal or command prompt.

5. Get Dependencies:
    Run "flutter pub get" to install the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file.
   
6. Run the Project:
    To run the app, use the command "flutter run". This will build and launch the app on your connected device or emulator.

7. Resolve Any Issues:
    If you encounter any errors or issues, check the error messages for details and make any necessary adjustments, such as updating Flutter or dependencies.

## Approach and Challenges

For the project's development, I used Flutter for the front-end development and Dart as the programming language. I implemented Firebase for data storage and real-time updates. I set up Firestore to store diary entries and reminders.

    Challenges faced:
    
1. Gradle Configuration Error:
    Encountered an error related to Gradle configuration while building the app.

2. Firebase Integration:
    Faced challenges with Firebase integration. Solved these by consulting Firebase documentation and debugging integration issues.
